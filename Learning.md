## What I learned

* A repository is a clone of the local files on a remote service
* Branches in repositories are used to isolate work to not merge with the main or master branch. Helps as a fail safe.
* Forking allows you to work on other projects
* A commit allows you to show your changes and a push takes your local branch to the remote one for review or pull request.
* Pull request allows you to get your changes reviewed and merged to the main branch.
